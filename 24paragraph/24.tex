	One of my earliest memories starts with me sobbing. I refused to be soothed no matter what Mom and Dad tried. 
	
	Dad gave up and left the bedroom, but Mom took me into the kitchen and sat me down at the breakfast table. 
	
	“Kan, kan,” she said, as she pulled a sheet of wrapping paper from on top of the fridge. For years, Mom carefully sliced open the wrappings around Christmas gifts and saved them on top of the fridge in a thick stack. 
	
	She set the paper down, plain side facing up, and began to fold it. I stopped crying and watched her, curious. 
	
	She turned the paper over and folded it again. She pleated, packed, tucked, rolled, and twisted until the paper disappeared between her cupped hands. Then she lifted the folded-up paper packet to her mouth and blew into it, like a balloon.
